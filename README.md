## Inspiration üí°
No student should have to choose between education and food. Our project aims to eliminate student hunger by providing nutritious meals at no cost. We believe that with community support and innovative solutions, we can ensure every student has the fuel they need to succeed academically and beyond. Together, let's end student food insecurity and build a brighter future for all.

## Problem Statement & Research üìë
Presently, the increasing alarm on the high prevalence of food insecurity among university students has received much attention among researchers ( [Research Paper 1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19320248.2018.1512928) ).
Globally, a recent systematic review on college/university students in the United States revealed that **14% to 59%** of them had undergone food insecurity, which exceeded the national prevalence (12.3%) ( [Research Paper 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8197461/) ).

## Our Solution
MealMates is a webapp designed to overcome student food insecurity by connecting students with nearby restaurants that provide free meals. The webapp facilitates student registration, enabling them to view a list of nearby restaurants offering free meals and request coupons from the organization. Donors can also register for an account and make donations to the organization, which utilizes these funds to reimburse restaurants for meals provided to students. MealMates aims to increase student access to free meals, alleviate the financial burden of food insecurity, raise awareness of the issue, and encourage support for student food insecurity initiatives.
